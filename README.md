## Introduction

**UniFi Tuner** is an intelligent automation tool built using Python and the Autogen AI Agent framework. It leverages advanced AI agents to automate various tasks, enhancing efficiency and productivity. This project focuses on creating modular and maintainable code to manage and deploy multiple AI agents effectively.

## Features

- **Modular AI Agents:** That asses the network and make recommendations on how to improve the network and also human in the loop agent to continue to ask clarifying questions on recommendations. 
- **Environment Configuration:** Securely manage API keys and model configurations using a `.env` file.
- **Group Chat Management:** Efficiently handle group chat interactions with multiple agents.
- **Logging & Error Handling:** Comprehensive logging for better debugging and error management.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed for scalability and ease of maintenance.

## Technologies Used


- **AI Framework:** Autogen AI Agent
- **Environment Management:** `python-dotenv`
- **Version Control:** Git

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.12** installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git** installed for version control. Download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- An **OpenAI API Key**. Sign up and obtain your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
- Create a local account on your unifi dream machine or controller and obtain the api credentials.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unifi_tuner.git
   cd unifi_tuner
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Ensure that your `requirements.txt` includes all necessary packages, such as `python-dotenv`, `autogen`, `flask`, etc.*

## Configuration

1. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following configurations:

   

   *Ensure that `.env` is included in your `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive information from being committed.*

2. **Update `.gitignore`**

   Your `.gitignore` should exclude unnecessary files and directories. Ensure it includes the following:

   ```gitignore:unifi_tuner/.gitignore
   # Ignore all JSON files
   *.json

   # Ignore recommendations.txt
   recommendations.txt

   # Ignore virtual environment directory
   myenv/

   # Ignore cache directories
   .cache/
   __pycache__/

   # Ignore simple_autogenexample.py
   simple_autogenexample.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Run the Application**

   Execute the main Python script to start the AI agents and manage group chat interactions.

   ```bash
   python unifi_ai_agents.py
   ```

3. **Logging**

   Logs are configured to display informational messages. Monitor the console output to observe interactions and identify any potential issues.
