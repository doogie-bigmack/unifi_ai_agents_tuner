## Introduction

**UniFi Tuner** is an intelligent automation tool built using Python and the Autogen AI Agent framework. It leverages advanced AI agents to automate various tasks, enhancing efficiency and productivity. This project focuses on creating modular and maintainable code to manage and deploy multiple AI agents effectively.

## Features

- **Modular AI Agents:** That assess the network and make recommendations on how to improve the network and also include a human-in-the-loop agent to continue asking clarifying questions on recommendations.
- **Environment Configuration:** Securely manage API keys and model configurations using a `.env` file.
- **Group Chat Management:** Efficiently handle group chat interactions with multiple agents.
- **Logging & Error Handling:** Comprehensive logging for better debugging and error management.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed for scalability and ease of maintenance.

## Technologies Used

- **AI Framework:** Autogen AI Agent
- **Environment Management:** `python-dotenv`
- **Version Control:** Git

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.12** installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git** installed for version control. Download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- An **OpenAI API Key**. Sign up and obtain your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
- Create a local account on your UniFi Dream Machine or controller and obtain the API credentials.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unifi_tuner.git
   cd unifi_tuner
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys and configurations.

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

   Add the following to `.env`:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following configurations: your unifi controller ip address, your unifi controller username and password, and your openai api key, logging level 

5. **Logging**

   Logs are configured to display informational messages. Monitor the console output to observe interactions and identify any potential issues.
